A framework for running simulations with ADCIRC.

Description
===========

This repository contains a collection of tools to easily benchmark, prototype and run ensemble simulations
with ADCIRC. One purpose of the library is to automate common workflows and tasks involved in simulations - such as
benchmark runs, parameter scans, editing parameter files, hostarts, etc. The goal is to provide a framework for
running simulations that supports complex workflows such as MCMC, Metropolis Sampling, Bayesian inversion, etc.
